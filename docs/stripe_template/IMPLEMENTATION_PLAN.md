# Stripe Integration Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Status ✓

### Database Schema ✓
- User model includes required Stripe fields:
  - stripeCustomerId (String, unique) for customer linking
  - subscriptionEndDate (DateTime) for subscription tracking
  - subscriptionTier (Enum) for status tracking

### API Implementation ✓

#### Checkout Route (`/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`) ✓
- Creates/retrieves Stripe customer
- Handles deleted customer cases
- Links customer ID with checkout session
- Passes customer data in session metadata

#### Success Route (`/api/stripe/success/route.ts`) ✓
- Stores Stripe customer ID
- Calculates and stores subscription end date
- Updates subscription status
- Handles both webhook and redirect flows

### Type Definitions ✓
- Updated NextAuth types to include:
  - stripeCustomerId
  - subscriptionEndDate
  - Proper subscription tier typing

## Important Notes

### Session Handling
- After successful payment, users need to log out and log back in to see their premium status
- A dedicated payment success page guides users through this process
- This approach ensures system stability and session consistency

### Environment Variables Required
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Security Notes
- All routes are protected with authentication
- User verification is done server-side
- Stripe webhook signatures should be verified (future enhancement)
- Payment intents are tied to specific users
- Customer IDs are unique and verified

### Known Limitations
1. No webhook verification yet
2. Basic error handling
3. Session requires re-login to reflect premium status
4. No automatic subscription renewal handling

### Future Enhancements
1. Add Stripe webhook handling for better payment verification
2. Add subscription management UI
   - View subscription status
   - View next billing date
   - Cancel subscription
   - Update payment method
3. Implement usage tracking
4. Add payment history
5. Add automatic renewal handling
6. Add subscription tiers
7. Implement subscription cancellation
8. Implement real-time session updates for premium status
9. Add webhook signature verification
10. Add subscription status checking using stored customer ID

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Check Stripe dashboard for payment status
3. Verify user session is active
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify database connection
6. If premium status isn't visible, try logging out and back in
7. Verify Stripe customer ID matches between systems
8. Check subscription end date calculation accuracy
9. Monitor webhook delivery status in Stripe dashboard
