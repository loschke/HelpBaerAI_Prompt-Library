# Stripe Integration Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Status

### Database Schema Updates Needed
1. Add new fields to User model in Prisma schema:
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  stripeCustomerId    String?   // To link Stripe customer with our user
  subscriptionEndDate DateTime? // To track when subscription expires
}
```

### API Updates Required
1. Update `/app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`:
   - Store Stripe Customer ID during checkout session creation
   - Pass customer ID to session metadata

2. Update `/app/api/stripe/success/route.ts`:
   - Extract subscription end date from Stripe response
   - Store both customer ID and subscription end date in database
   - Update user record with new fields

### Implementation Steps
1. Database Migration
   - Create new Prisma migration for additional fields
   - Apply migration to database
   - Update TypeScript types

2. Stripe Integration Enhancement
   - Modify checkout session creation to include customer data
   - Update success handler to capture additional fields
   - Implement customer ID storage logic
   - Add subscription end date calculation

3. Testing Requirements
   - Verify customer ID is correctly stored
   - Verify subscription end date is accurate
   - Test subscription renewal impact
   - Validate customer ID linking

## Important Notes

### Session Handling
- After successful payment, users need to log out and log back in to see their premium status
- A dedicated payment success page guides users through this process
- This approach ensures system stability and session consistency

### Environment Variables Required
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Security Notes
- All routes are protected with authentication
- User verification is done server-side
- Stripe webhook signatures should be verified (future enhancement)
- Payment intents are tied to specific users

### Known Limitations
1. No webhook verification yet
2. Basic error handling
3. Session requires re-login to reflect premium status

### Future Enhancements
1. Add Stripe webhook handling for better payment verification
2. Add subscription management UI
3. Implement usage tracking
4. Add payment history
5. Add automatic renewal handling
6. Add subscription tiers
7. Implement subscription cancellation
8. Implement real-time session updates for premium status
9. Add subscription status checking using stored customer ID
10. Implement automatic subscription end date updates

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Check Stripe dashboard for payment status
3. Verify user session is active
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify database connection
6. If premium status isn't visible, try logging out and back in
7. Verify Stripe customer ID matches between systems
8. Check subscription end date calculation accuracy
